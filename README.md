# Arup Stem Workshop

Hello and welcome to this workshop hosted by Arup.

## Part 1:
### Introduction to the IoT

IoT stands for Internet of Things. A concept where everything is connected to the internet, from smart devices to your everyday appliances.

So why would you want to connect everything to the internet? Lets say you're using your favourite pen, writing a all your best ideas down. Just as you get to your last sentence, your ink runs out!!!
if there was only a way that you could know when it was about to run out so you could buy a new pen before hand. IoT solves that problem. You could add a small connected sensor in your pen that would send a message to the internet letting you know via your favourite app that your pen is about to run out!

But it gets even better, it could buy it for you so you're always stocked!

Now lets take this up a notch, smart fridges, imagine never having to worry about having enough milk in the fridge because your fridge will buy it for you.

### The challenge

STEM buildings limited has approached Arup with a new and interesting project idea! They want to develop a system that can control meeting room lights from any location.

As a innovative firm Arup has opted to use the IoT to solve this problem and has chosen your team to get the job done.

### Fundamental requirements
## Part 2:
### Design and plan
The first step in going to be figuring out how our solution is going to work,
### Purchasing parts
What you need:

## Part 3:
### Software development
Lets begin by writing some code!

Press the windows key on your keyboard, type cmd and press the return key.

This window is called the command line or the terminal

In the terminal type the following two commands

```
mkdir project
cd project
```

You've just created a folder called "project" using ```mkdir project``` and you've moved into it using ```cd project```

Now we're going to download the Arduino project from our code repository using the command
```cmd
git clone https://gitlab.arup.com/Syed.Hasan/SW.git
cd SW
```

Open the code using the following command

```cmd
start code.ino
```

The editor will look like this

The first bit of code we can see are the include statements, which point to libraries our code will need to work.
